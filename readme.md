The next result shows that det A is a linear transformation when regarded as a function of a fixed
column of A. The proof is Exercise 3.1.21.
Theorem 3.1.6
Given columns c1 , · · · , c j−1 , c j+1 , · · · , cn in Rn , define T : Rn → R by

T (x) = det c1 · · · c j−1 x c j+1 · · · cn for all x in Rn
Then, for all x and y in Rn and all a in R,
T (x + y) = T (x) + T (y)
and
T (ax) = aT (x)
